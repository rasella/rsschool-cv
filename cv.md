# About Me
I work as a linux engineer in a small company.
I am engaged in the operation of client services, from their configuration to troubleshooting.
In work, I have to periodically modify and test the software - this is my favorite part of the job.

I want to upgrade my knowledge in the field of front-end development for further retraining as a web developer.
